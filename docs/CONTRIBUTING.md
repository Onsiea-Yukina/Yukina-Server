# How to contribute to Yukina Server

- To start, do not hesitate to contribute, we thank you in advance for all contributions.

## For all types of contributions

- **No duplicate** - Check if whatever contribution you plan to offer is not already present, You can check the page
  ["issues" of this repository](https://github.com/Onsiea-Yukina/Yukina-Server/issues) to avoid any duplication

- **Courtesy and joy** - Be sure to remain courteous, polite, and non-arrogant.

- **Clear and efficient** - Make sure that the titles chosen reflect the subject and that this and description are clear

## To report any problem whatsoever

- **Security vulnerability** - In order to avoid incidents as much as possible, for this type of problem it should be
  transmitted directly and secretly to a member of the Onsiea-Yukina team, who will send a press release once it has been
  resolved. ([contact Onsiea-Yukina](https://github.com/Onsiea-Yukina/Yukina-Server/wiki/Contact) author: seynax@onsiea.com),
  for more details you can read
  the [security policy informations](https://github.com/Onsiea-Yukina/Yukina-Server/blob/main/docs/SECURITY.md#security-policy)

- **Model** - To help you
  a [model](<github_url>/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) to state the problem
  is at your disposal

- **Useful information** - If possible, you can specify sample code or a scenario where the problem is or would be
  apparent.

- **Predict and solve** - Even without having suffered a problem, you can very well, take a code as an example, while
  specifying that this one could be in the future a source of problem, on what scale, to what extent, in which scenario
  etc.

- **Already a fix ?** If you have an idea to solve this problem or if you already have a patch that corrects it, please
  let us know!

## Suggest improvements

- **Model** - To help you
  a [model](https://github.com/Onsiea-Yukina/Yukina-Server/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md) to suggest
  improvement is at your disposal

- **Useful information** - You can specify how this idea improves anything and in what aspect (performance, stability,
  code readability etc)

- **Cosmetic improvement ?** - All improvements suggestions are taken seriously, including readability, layout,
  formatting etc of the code.

    - **Yes all the same** - despite everything, some choices may have been made for a specific reason, so we will never
      choose the beauty of the code to the detriment of bugs, various problems etc.

    - **Traceability of choices** - thus, following a request of this type, if it was not accepted with valid
      justification, it will be published in the "choice / <path_to_class> /class.txt" folder (for example (choice /
      fr.yukina.yukina-server / Main), so in the future it will not be necessary to propose this improvement (at least,
      with the same arguments) and it will not be necessary to find the justification - which takes much less time.

    - **And therefore in final ?** - therefore you can check in the folder "choice / <path_to_the_class> /class.txt" if
      your proposal has not already been made, you can also obtain the reason

## Any questions ?
